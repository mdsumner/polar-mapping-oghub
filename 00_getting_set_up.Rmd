# Getting Set Up

We need the latest versions of these R packages installed from GitHub. 

It's best to run each line in turn in case there are issues or the user needs to provide input. 

```{r setup, eval = FALSE}
## make sure we have the packages we need

if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
req1 <- c("maps", "maptools", "sp")
remotes::install_cran(req1)
```
