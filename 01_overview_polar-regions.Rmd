What is required for mapping in polar regions? 

* shape-feature orientations, the dateline and the poles
* handling of data in long-lat, understanding of metrics and shape (area, length, angle)
* projected maps can be very hard to do, each has its own issues
* quantities like vector fields
* conventions for globabl data -180/180, 0/360
